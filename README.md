 Minecraft plugin for managing horses and races. 
 
This is a Minecraft plugin made to improve the way horses are used and managed on a multiplayer server. A player can tame horses, which then show up in a nice visual GUI with horse detials. Horses are protected against player damage, although they are not made immune. Tamed horses also cannot be manipulated by anyone other than the owner. Horse information is currently stored in a flatfile, and a few things are configurable.
Now, horse speed and jump strength can be changed by training a horse. The more you ride it and jump with it, the better it will get. 
The plugin has a minigame horse-racing aspect. Races can be created, and then players can join the race and pick which horse to race. This part is still very much under development and is not complete, although a single race can be run. 
Most of this is done through commands, or can be done through the config files as well. In the future, I am planning on making this plugin more customizable, as well as adding MySQL support. 

## Info: 
**API Version:** Spigot API 1.16</br>

## To Use:
### Taming: 
Tame a horse as normal. You will get a free name tag to name the horse. If you have the special nametag, you do not need to use an anvil: you can simply use the command. This is for the first naming only! 

### Commands: 
**/horse** - commands to manage horses </br>
**/game** - commands to join or start a game</br>
**/hrace** - commands to create a race</br>

### Notes: 
This plugin is most certainly not complete yet, but I wanted to showcase my progress so far. Thanks for reading!
